# Analyzing-Crime-in-Los-Angeles
This project supports the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by conducting a comprehensive analysis of crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior across the city. Using the crimes.csv dataset sourced from Los Angeles Open Data, the analysis explores crime trends, geographic distributions, and behavioral patterns to provide actionable insights. The goal is to help law enforcement effectively allocate resources to high-crime areas and develop targeted strategies to tackle various types of criminal offenses. Through exploratory data analysis, this project contributes to public safety efforts by highlighting crime hotspots, seasonal variations, and priority areas requiring immediate attention and intervention.​
